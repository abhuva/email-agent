# Description: Create the system to maintain a Markdown table of processed emails
# Details:
Implement functionality to create and update a Markdown changelog file at the configured path. The file should contain a table with columns for Timestamp, Email Account, Subject, From, and Filename. Each execution run should be visually separated. The function should handle cases where the file doesn't exist yet and where it needs to be appended to.

# Test Strategy:
Test with new and existing changelog files. Verify the table format is maintained correctly when appending new entries. Check that all required information is included and properly formatted.
