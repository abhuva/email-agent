# Task ID: 9
# Title: Implement note creation and email tagging workflow
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3, 8
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the core workflow that processes emails, creates notes, and applies appropriate tags
# Details:
Implement the main workflow that: 1) Processes each selected email, 2) Generates the Markdown note content, 3) Writes the file to the configured location, 4) Tags the email with [Obsidian-Note-Created] on success or [Note-Creation-Failed] on failure. Include comprehensive error handling at each step, ensuring the email is always tagged appropriately based on the outcome.

# Test Strategy:
Test the complete workflow with various email scenarios. Verify files are created correctly and emails are tagged appropriately. Test error handling by simulating failures at different stages of the process.
