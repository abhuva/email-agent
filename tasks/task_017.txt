# Task ID: 17
# Title: Comprehensive Documentation Audit and Consolidation for V3 Features
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 16, 18
# Priority: medium
# Description: Perform a thorough review of all project documentation to ensure completeness, accuracy, and consistency with the V3 implementation, while removing outdated content and consolidating duplicate information.
# Details:
This task involves a systematic review of all documentation files in the project repository with the following specific actions:

1. Create an inventory of all existing documentation files and their purposes
2. Cross-reference all V3 features with their documentation coverage, identifying any gaps
3. Remove or update any references to deprecated features or outdated examples
4. Verify all code snippets and examples against the current codebase to ensure they work as documented
5. Check API references for accuracy, ensuring parameter names, types, and descriptions match implementation
6. Identify and consolidate duplicate documentation across different files
7. Update MAIN_DOCS.md to serve as a comprehensive entry point with proper navigation to all documentation sections
8. Ensure consistent formatting, terminology, and style across all documentation
9. Add version information where appropriate to help users understand which features apply to their version
10. Check for broken links or references within the documentation
11. Verify that installation instructions, prerequisites, and configuration steps are current
12. Update troubleshooting guides to address common issues with the V3 implementation

# Test Strategy:
The documentation audit should be validated through the following methods:

1. Create a documentation coverage matrix that maps each V3 feature to its corresponding documentation
2. Perform a peer review where at least two team members who didn't write the original documentation verify its accuracy
3. Execute all code examples in an isolated environment to confirm they work as documented
4. Use automated link checkers to verify all internal and external links are valid
5. Have a new team member attempt to use the documentation to perform specific tasks, noting any points of confusion
6. Validate MAIN_DOCS.md navigation by ensuring every documentation file is accessible through its links
7. Create a checklist of common documentation issues (inconsistent terminology, outdated screenshots, etc.) and verify each document against this list
8. Compare API documentation against actual implementation using automated tools or manual inspection of the codebase
9. Test the documentation on different devices and browsers to ensure readability and proper formatting
10. Document any issues found during testing in a separate report, categorized by severity and type
