# Task ID: 6
# Title: Implement conditional summarization logic
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create the system to conditionally generate summaries based on email tags
# Details:
Develop logic that checks if an email has any tags matching those in the summarization_tags configuration. If it does, load the summarization prompt from the configured path and prepare for an LLM call. Include error handling for missing prompt files and invalid configurations. The system should gracefully continue without summarization if any part fails.

# Test Strategy:
Test with emails having various tag combinations, including those that should and shouldn't trigger summarization. Verify the system correctly identifies emails for summarization based on configuration.
