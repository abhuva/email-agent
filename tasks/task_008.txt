# Task ID: 8
# Title: Create Obsidian note assembly and formatting
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4, 5, 7
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement the functionality to assemble and format complete Obsidian notes
# Details:
Develop a function that assembles the complete Markdown note by combining: 1) YAML frontmatter, 2) Summary section (if available) formatted as an Obsidian callout, and 3) Original email content under a 'Original Content' heading. Ensure proper spacing and formatting between sections. The function should produce a complete, well-formatted Markdown file ready for writing to disk.

# Test Strategy:
Test with various combinations of inputs including with and without summaries. Verify the output is valid Markdown that renders correctly in Obsidian with proper section formatting.
