# Task ID: 7
# Title: Implement LLM integration for email summarization
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create the functionality to call an LLM API for generating email summaries
# Details:
Implement the LLM API call functionality using the loaded prompt and email content. Structure the prompt to generate concise, informative summaries focusing on key points and action items. Include error handling for API failures, rate limiting, and malformed responses. The system should log errors but continue processing if summarization fails.

# Test Strategy:
Test with various email contents including short messages, long threads, and emails with different structures. Verify the summaries are accurate and helpful. Test error handling by simulating API failures.
