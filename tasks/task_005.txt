# Description: Create functionality to clean and convert email body content to Markdown format
# Details:
Implement a function that takes an email body (which may be HTML or plain text) and converts it to clean Markdown. Handle HTML emails by converting tags to Markdown equivalents. Strip or replace problematic content like inline images. Preserve important formatting like lists, links, and emphasis. Sanitize any potentially harmful content.

# Test Strategy:
Test with various email formats including plain text, HTML with formatting, emails with inline images, and emails with special characters. Verify the output is valid Markdown that renders correctly in Obsidian.
