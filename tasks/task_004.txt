# Task ID: 4
# Title: Implement YAML frontmatter generation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Create functionality to extract email metadata and format it as YAML frontmatter
# Details:
Develop a function that extracts required metadata from email objects (subject, from, to, cc, date, source_message_id) and formats it as valid YAML frontmatter. Handle edge cases like missing fields, malformed dates, and special characters. Ensure the function produces valid YAML that Obsidian can parse correctly.

# Test Strategy:
Test with various email formats including those with missing fields, special characters in headers, and different date formats. Verify the output is valid YAML that Obsidian can parse.
