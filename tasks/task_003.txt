# Task ID: 3
# Title: Create file system utilities for Obsidian integration
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop utility functions for file path handling, sanitization, and I/O operations
# Details:
Create a module with functions for: 1) Sanitizing email subjects for filenames (removing invalid characters), 2) Generating unique, timestamped filenames following the YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS - <Sanitized-Subject>.md format, 3) Safely writing files with proper error handling, 4) Checking for file existence and path validity. Include comprehensive error handling for all file operations.

# Test Strategy:
Test filename generation with various email subjects including special characters. Verify file writing works with proper permissions and fails gracefully with insufficient permissions.
