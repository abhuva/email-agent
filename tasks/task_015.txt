# Task ID: 15
# Title: Prepare documentation and deployment instructions
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 14
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create comprehensive documentation for setup, configuration, and usage
# Details:
Prepare detailed documentation covering: 1) Installation and setup, 2) Configuration options with examples, 3) Usage instructions, 4) Troubleshooting guide, 5) Explanation of the note format and how to use it in Obsidian. Include information about the phased rollout plan described in the PRD.

# Test Strategy:
Review documentation for accuracy and completeness. Have a team member follow the instructions to verify they are clear and complete. Test configuration examples to ensure they work as described.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Draft Installation and Setup Documentation [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the first section of documentation detailing how users can install and initially set up the software, including prerequisites, step-by-step instructions, and verification steps.
### Details:
Structure as a markdown file with headings for prerequisites (e.g., system requirements, dependencies), numbered installation steps (e.g., download, extract, run installer), initial configuration commands, and a verification checklist. Include code snippets for common platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux) and screenshots if applicable. Ensure steps are testable and reference any required tools like Node.js or Git.

## 2. Document Configuration Options with Examples [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.1
### Description: Develop the configuration section explaining all available options, their purposes, default values, and practical examples for common use cases.
### Details:
Use a table format to list options (parameter name, type, default, description), followed by YAML/JSON example configs for basic, advanced, and Obsidian-specific setups. Include validation steps and common pitfalls. Reference setup from subtask 1 for initial config file location. Test examples by applying them locally.

## 3. Write Usage Instructions and Note Format Explanation [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.1, 15.2
### Description: Prepare usage guide covering core workflows, command-line/API usage, and specific instructions for the note format integration with Obsidian including syntax examples and plugins.
### Details:
Organize into subsections: quick start, daily usage, advanced features, and Obsidian section with note format spec (e.g., frontmatter, tags, Markdown extensions), embedding examples, and vault setup. Include copy-paste code blocks and workflow diagrams. Build on prior sections by cross-referencing installation and config.

## 4. Create Troubleshooting Guide [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.1, 15.2, 15.3
### Description: Compile a comprehensive troubleshooting section addressing common errors, diagnostic steps, log analysis, and solutions for installation, config, usage, and Obsidian issues.
### Details:
Categorize by error type (e.g., installation failures, config parsing errors, runtime issues, Obsidian sync problems) with symptoms, causes, step-by-step fixes, and prevention tips. Include log file locations from config docs and testing commands. Validate by simulating errors from previous subtasks.

## 5. Incorporate Phased Rollout Plan and Finalize Documentation [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.1, 15.2, 15.3, 15.4
### Description: Add a dedicated section explaining the phased rollout plan from the PRD with timelines, milestones, and user guidance, then compile all sections into a cohesive document with deployment instructions.
### Details:
Extract PRD rollout details into phases (e.g., internal testing, beta, full release) with objectives, milestones, responsibilities, feedback mechanisms, and user participation instructions per phase. Use tables/Gantt-style timelines. Add deployment section (e.g., hosting, CI/CD if applicable). Review entire doc for consistency, add index/table of contents, and export to PDF/HTML. Reference rollout templates for structure like phases, checkpoints, and metrics.
