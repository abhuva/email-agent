# Blacklist Rules Configuration
#
# Blacklist rules are applied BEFORE AI processing (pre-processing).
# Rules can either DROP emails (skip processing entirely) or RECORD them
# (generate a raw markdown file without AI classification).
#
# Rule Structure:
#   - trigger: The field to match against ("sender", "subject", or "domain")
#   - value: The value to match (exact match for sender/subject, domain match for domain)
#   - action: What to do when matched ("drop" or "record")
#
# Rule Evaluation:
#   - Rules are evaluated in order (first match wins)
#   - Whitelist rules are checked before blacklist rules (whitelist takes precedence)
#   - If no match, email proceeds to normal processing
#
# Matching Semantics:
#   - "sender": Exact match against email sender address
#   - "subject": Exact match against email subject line
#   - "domain": Domain match (matches any email from that domain)
#
# Performance Considerations:
#   - Rules are evaluated for every email, so keep the list concise
#   - Use domain matching for blocking entire domains (more efficient)
#   - Avoid overly broad patterns that might match legitimate emails

# ============================================================================
# Example Rules
# ============================================================================
# Uncomment and customize the rules below, or add your own.

# Example 1: Drop all emails from a specific spam sender
# - trigger: "sender"
#   value: "no-reply@spam.com"
#   action: "drop"  # Skip this email entirely (no processing, no file generation)

# Example 2: Drop all emails from a spam domain
# - trigger: "domain"
#   value: "spam-domain.com"
#   action: "drop"  # Drop all emails from this domain

# Example 3: Record emails with specific subject (skip AI but create file)
# - trigger: "subject"
#   value: "Unsubscribe"
#   action: "record"  # Generate raw markdown but skip AI processing

# Example 4: Drop newsletter emails from a specific sender
# - trigger: "sender"
#   value: "newsletter@example.com"
#   action: "drop"

# Example 5: Record automated notifications (skip AI, but keep record)
# - trigger: "subject"
#   value: "Automated Notification"
#   action: "record"

# Example 6: Drop all emails from a domain (useful for blocking entire domains)
# - trigger: "domain"
#   value: "unwanted-domain.com"
#   action: "drop"

# ============================================================================
# Common Use Cases
# ============================================================================

# Block spam senders:
# - trigger: "sender"
#   value: "spam@example.com"
#   action: "drop"

# Block entire spam domains:
# - trigger: "domain"
#   value: "spam-domain.com"
#   action: "drop"

# Skip AI processing for automated emails (but keep record):
# - trigger: "subject"
#   value: "Automated"
#   action: "record"

# Block specific notification types:
# - trigger: "subject"
#   value: "Unsubscribe"
#   action: "drop"

# ============================================================================
# Rule Management
# ============================================================================
# To disable a rule temporarily, comment it out with #:
#   # - trigger: "sender"
#   #   value: "spam@example.com"
#   #   action: "drop"
#
# To add a new rule, add it to the list below:
#   - trigger: "sender"
#     value: "new-spam@example.com"
#     action: "drop"
#
# Rule IDs are not required - rules are identified by their position in the list.
# The order matters: first matching rule wins.

# ============================================================================
# Active Rules
# ============================================================================
# Add your active rules below. If no rules are needed, leave this list empty.
# The list must be valid YAML (use [] for empty list).

# Empty list - no active rules
# Uncomment and customize the examples above, or add your own rules here:
