# Blacklist Rules Configuration
# 
# Blacklist rules are applied BEFORE AI processing (pre-processing).
# Rules can either DROP emails (skip processing entirely) or RECORD them
# (generate a raw markdown file without AI classification).
#
# Rule Structure:
# - trigger: The field to match against ("sender", "subject", or "domain")
# - value: The value to match (exact match for sender/subject, domain match for domain)
# - action: What to do when matched ("drop" or "record")
#
# Examples:
# - trigger: "sender"
#   value: "no-reply@spam.com"
#   action: "drop"  # Skip this email entirely
#
# - trigger: "domain"
#   value: "spam-domain.com"
#   action: "drop"  # Drop all emails from this domain
#
# - trigger: "subject"
#   value: "Unsubscribe"
#   action: "record"  # Generate raw markdown but skip AI processing
#
# blocked_items: []
