# Whitelist Rules Configuration
#
# Whitelist rules are applied AFTER AI processing (post-processing).
# Rules can boost importance scores and add tags to emails that match.
#
# Rule Structure:
# - trigger: The field to match against ("sender", "subject", or "domain")
# - value: The value to match (exact match for sender/subject, domain match for domain)
# - action: Must be "boost" for whitelist rules
# - score_boost: Integer value to add to importance_score (e.g., 20 adds 20 points)
# - add_tags: List of tags to add to the email (e.g., ["#vip", "#work"])
#
# Examples:
# - trigger: "domain"
#   value: "important-client.com"
#   action: "boost"
#   score_boost: 20
#   add_tags: ["#vip", "#work"]
#
# - trigger: "sender"
#   value: "boss@company.com"
#   action: "boost"
#   score_boost: 15
#   add_tags: ["#priority"]
#
# - trigger: "subject"
#   value: "URGENT"
#   action: "boost"
#   score_boost: 10
#   add_tags: ["#urgent"]
#
