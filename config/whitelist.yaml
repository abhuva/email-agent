# Whitelist Rules Configuration
#
# Whitelist rules are applied AFTER AI processing (post-processing).
# Rules can boost importance scores and add tags to emails that match.
#
# Rule Structure:
#   - trigger: The field to match against ("sender", "subject", or "domain")
#   - value: The value to match (exact match for sender/subject, domain match for domain)
#   - action: Must be "boost" for whitelist rules
#   - score_boost: Integer value to add to importance_score (e.g., 20 adds 20 points)
#   - add_tags: List of tags to add to the email (e.g., ["#vip", "#work"])
#
# Rule Evaluation:
#   - Rules are evaluated in order (all matching rules are applied)
#   - Whitelist rules are applied after LLM classification but before note generation
#   - Multiple whitelist rules can match and all boosts/tags are accumulated
#   - Score boosts are additive (multiple matches = sum of all boosts)
#   - Tags are merged (all matching tags are added)
#
# Matching Semantics:
#   - "sender": Exact match against email sender address
#   - "subject": Exact match against email subject line
#   - "domain": Domain match (matches any email from that domain)
#
# Score Boosting:
#   - score_boost is added to the LLM's importance_score
#   - Typical values: 5-30 points (importance_score range is 0-10, but boosts can exceed)
#   - Use higher boosts for critical senders/domains
#   - Multiple matching rules: boosts are summed
#
# Tags:
#   - Tags are added to the email's tag list
#   - Format: ["#tag1", "#tag2"] (include # prefix)
#   - Multiple matching rules: all tags are merged
#   - Tags appear in generated Obsidian notes
#
# Performance Considerations:
#   - Rules are evaluated for every email, so keep the list concise
#   - Use domain matching for boosting entire domains (more efficient)
#   - Avoid overly broad patterns that might match unintended emails

# ============================================================================
# Example Rules
# ============================================================================
# Uncomment and customize the rules below, or add your own.

# Example 1: Boost importance for important client domain
# - trigger: "domain"
#   value: "important-client.com"
#   action: "boost"
#   score_boost: 20  # Add 20 points to importance_score
#   add_tags: ["#vip", "#work"]  # Add these tags to the email

# Example 2: Boost importance for boss emails
# - trigger: "sender"
#   value: "boss@company.com"
#   action: "boost"
#   score_boost: 15  # Add 15 points to importance_score
#   add_tags: ["#priority"]  # Add priority tag

# Example 3: Boost importance for urgent subject lines
# - trigger: "subject"
#   value: "URGENT"
#   action: "boost"
#   score_boost: 10  # Add 10 points to importance_score
#   add_tags: ["#urgent"]  # Add urgent tag

# Example 4: Boost importance for important project domain
# - trigger: "domain"
#   value: "project-partner.com"
#   action: "boost"
#   score_boost: 25  # Add 25 points to importance_score
#   add_tags: ["#project", "#important"]  # Add multiple tags

# Example 5: Boost importance for specific sender (client)
# - trigger: "sender"
#   value: "client@example.com"
#   action: "boost"
#   score_boost: 18  # Add 18 points to importance_score
#   add_tags: ["#client"]  # Add client tag

# Example 6: Boost importance for domain and add work tag
# - trigger: "domain"
#   value: "work-partner.com"
#   action: "boost"
#   score_boost: 12  # Add 12 points to importance_score
#   add_tags: ["#work", "#partner"]  # Add work and partner tags

# ============================================================================
# Common Use Cases
# ============================================================================

# Boost important clients:
# - trigger: "domain"
#   value: "important-client.com"
#   action: "boost"
#   score_boost: 20
#   add_tags: ["#vip", "#client"]

# Boost boss/manager emails:
# - trigger: "sender"
#   value: "manager@company.com"
#   action: "boost"
#   score_boost: 15
#   add_tags: ["#priority", "#boss"]

# Boost urgent subject lines:
# - trigger: "subject"
#   value: "URGENT"
#   action: "boost"
#   score_boost: 10
#   add_tags: ["#urgent"]

# Boost project-related domains:
# - trigger: "domain"
#   value: "project-domain.com"
#   action: "boost"
#   score_boost: 18
#   add_tags: ["#project"]

# ============================================================================
# Score Boost Guidelines
# ============================================================================
# Typical importance_score range from LLM: 0-10
# Score boosts are added to this base score, so final scores can exceed 10.
#
# Recommended boost values:
#   - Low priority: 5-10 points (slight boost)
#   - Medium priority: 10-15 points (moderate boost)
#   - High priority: 15-25 points (significant boost)
#   - Critical: 25+ points (maximum boost)
#
# Example:
#   - LLM importance_score: 7
#   - Whitelist boost: +20
#   - Final importance_score: 27
#   - Result: Email is marked as important (even if threshold is 8)

# ============================================================================
# Tag Guidelines
# ============================================================================
# Tags are added to generated Obsidian notes and help with organization.
#
# Tag format:
#   - Include # prefix: ["#work", "#vip"]
#   - Use lowercase, hyphenated: ["#work-project", "#client-xyz"]
#   - Keep tags concise and meaningful
#
# Common tag categories:
#   - Priority: ["#priority", "#urgent", "#important"]
#   - Context: ["#work", "#personal", "#client"]
#   - Projects: ["#project-name", "#project-abc"]
#   - People: ["#boss", "#team", "#client-name"]

# ============================================================================
# Rule Management
# ============================================================================
# To disable a rule temporarily, comment it out with #:
#   # - trigger: "domain"
#   #   value: "important-client.com"
#   #   action: "boost"
#   #   score_boost: 20
#   #   add_tags: ["#vip"]
#
# To add a new rule, add it to the list below:
#   - trigger: "sender"
#     value: "new-important@example.com"
#     action: "boost"
#     score_boost: 15
#     add_tags: ["#important"]
#
# Rule IDs are not required - rules are identified by their position in the list.
# The order matters: all matching rules are applied (unlike blacklist where first match wins).

# ============================================================================
# Active Rules
# ============================================================================
# Add your active rules below. If no rules are needed, leave this list empty.
# The list must be valid YAML (use [] for empty list).

# Empty list - no active rules
# Uncomment and customize the examples above, or add your own rules here:
