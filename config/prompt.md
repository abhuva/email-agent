# Email Classification

Analyze the following email and classify it into one of these categories:

- **urgent**: Work-related, important, has clear due dates or tasks
- **neutral**: Default category for most emails
- **spam**: Only tag if you are really sure it's spam (low false positive rate is important)

Reply with a single keyword only: `urgent`, `neutral`, or `spam`.
